# Polygon-DNS-service


Anyone will be able to purchase a domain NFT and point it to something with a scaled-down version of ENS on the Polygon blockchain.
The data in your contract will be universal once it is on the blockchain, which is fantastic!
Anyone can look at what it's pointing to and read the names.
Furthermore, no one can destroy your awesome domain or remove your data because blockchains are immutable!
